# COMP382-Assign-1 DIVISION OF WORK:

Our first approach was to read Chapter 1 of the textbook to get a good understanding of the topic and what we are dealing with. After we've done that, we decided that I (Andrea) would work on the first few steps of creating the GNFA from the DFA of Figure 1.6.
Basically, the idea is that I would work on the first half while Jang would work on the second half. On top of this, we decided we would split the work based on the assignment's rubric.

Andrea Pezzella:
- Explains why we chose the topic
- Writes the initial part of the step-by-step CONVERT explanation (DFA → special GNFA).
- Ensures correct notation

Jang Toor ---> 
- Writes the final part of the step-by-step CONVERT explanation (DFA → special GNFA).
- Creates the final GNFA diagram (design of figure)


Both of us will also constantly crosscheck the work of each other, making sure we are on the right path.
