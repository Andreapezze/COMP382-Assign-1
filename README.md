`/figures` – Step-by-step GNFA diagrams

Our first approach was to read Chapter 1 of the textbook to get a good understanding of the topic and what we are dealing with. After we've done that, we decided that I (Andrea) would work on the drawing of the steps of creating the GNFA from the DFA of Figure 1.6.
Basically, the idea is that I would work on the figures while Jang would double-check my work and write the explanation report. 

Andrea Pezzella:
- Explained why we chose the topic
- Drew the step-by-step CONVERT algorithm figures (DFA → special GNFA).
- References

Jang Toor:
- Wrote the report for the step-by-step CONVERT explanation (DFA → special GNFA).
- Double-checked correct notation

Both of us will also constantly crosscheck the work of each other, making sure we are on the right path.
